# Overview

This software is a simple interactive memory game called Simon Says, where players repeat an increasingly long sequence of flashing colored buttons. It runs entirely in the browser and updates in real time based on user interaction.

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript by manipulating the DOM, handling events, and managing game logic. It also served as a practical exercise in structuring a clean project folder, testing functionality, and applying CSS for dynamic visual feedbackâ€”laying the groundwork for future, more advanced web development projects.
